# Automerge

Automerge is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications.

## Automatic merging

Automerge is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT), which allows concurrent changes on different devices to be merged automatically without requiring any central server.

## Network-agnostic

Use any connection-oriented network protocol: client-server, peer-to-peer, or local. Or use unidirectional messaging: send an Automerge file as an email attachment or store it on a file server.

## Portable

Implemented in JavaScript and Rust, with FFI bindings across platforms including iOS, Electron, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, and more.
